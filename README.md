App: Dream NBA Lineup  
Description:  This website allows users to create their own dream 5-man NBA lineup of current players playing. We allow users to remove their lineup, but also grant the admin the ability to remove all the lineups. The website utilizes the rapidapi-api-nba to confirm if the players the user selected are current players, along with their jersey numbers.
